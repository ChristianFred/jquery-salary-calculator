# Project Name
Jquery Salary Calculator

## Description
The problem was to create a Salary Calculator that took in name, id, title, and salary. And then It needed to apply them in a list on the DOM along with the total monthly salary between all the list items within the salary compartment. If the number was higher then 20,000 then the background needed to be red. There also needed to be a delete button that could remove an entry but didn't have to remove the price in the total.
